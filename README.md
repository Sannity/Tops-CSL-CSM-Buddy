# Tops CSL/CSM Buddy

As a Customer Service Lead/Manager at Tops Friendly Markets ther are many weekly tasks that could be automated in order to save time and allow for more customer interaction for these associates. Tasks such as the weekly register lineups can be automatically generated using information readily available in the Tops computer systems. For now manual entry will be sufficient to show the viability of the product.

## Stored Associate Statistics

Every store associate has many statistics that are not accessable to current Tops CSLs for use. Stuff such as

+ Is the associate trained in any departments
... Such as the Meat Department, Office, Deli, Bakery, Produce, Stock
+ How many days of Green Box Accountability does the associate have left?
... When an associate is 20 dollars short or over in their drawer they go on green box accountability, they must be counted in and out every shift for three days. If in that time they are off anything over or under 10 dollars they must be put on another 3 days of accountability. We will store the ammount of days from 0-N and notify the CSL if they are on accountability.
+ is the associate trained on the self checkouts?

## Break Managemet

Associates breaks on the front end are controlled based on the length of shift. In New York, any shift shorter than 6 hours requires one 15 minute break, 6 hour shifts require one 20 minute break, and anything over 6 hours requires two fifteen minute breaks with a 30 minute lunch in the middle. These breaks must be situated in such a way where they do not overlap and avoid peak times

## Register Lineup Creation

The distribution of front end associates into the available registers. There are rules to this that must be implememnted.

+ No more than 4 people can be placed on a register per day
+ The express register (Register 1 in my store) must be open 9am - 9pm or as close to that as possible
+ The self-checkouts must be open for the entire length of the store operation
+ If an associate is on _Green Box Accountability_ they must be on a regiser alone if possible
+ Any associate not trained for Self Checkouts cannot be put on those registers

There are more rules, but this is just a few common ones that apply in many situations.
